# Customer-Segmentation-with-RFM-Analysis-Python-
📝 Task Overview 

This project performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Using transaction data from a retail store, the goal is to identify customer groups and suggest targeted marketing strategies.

📁 Dataset

Source: Online Retail Dataset – UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Contains ~500,000 transactions from a UK-based online retail store between 2010 and 2011.


🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset: remove missing data, filter valid transactions

Calculate RFM metrics for each customer:

Recency: Days since last purchase

Frequency: Number of purchases

Monetary: Total amount spent

Score each customer on a scale (e.g. 1–5) for each RFM metric

Create a composite RFM score for segmentation

Group customers into meaningful segments (e.g., Champions, Loyal, At-Risk)


🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – for data transformation and RFM calculation

Seaborn / Matplotlib / Plotly – for visualization

(Optionally Excel for early data review)
